/*
 * In an array of integers,
 * a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers
 * and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers.
 * For example, in the array {5, 8, 4, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are peaks and {5, 2} are valleys.
 * Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.

Example:

Input: [5, 3, 1, 2, 3] -> [1,2,3,3,5] -> [1,5,3,2,3]
Output:Â [5, 1, 3, 2, 3]
Note:

nums.length <= 10000
