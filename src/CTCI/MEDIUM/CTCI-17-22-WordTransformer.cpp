/*
 * Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary, write a method to transform one word into another word by changing only one letter at a time. The new word you get in each step must be in the dictionary.

Write code to return a possible transforming sequence. If there is more than one sequence, return any of them.

Example 1:

Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
["hit","hot","dot","lot","log","cog"]
Example 2:

Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []

Explanation:Â endWord "cog" is not in the dictionary, so there's no possible transforming sequence.
